# Colored Game

## Game Rules:
- The game board 18x18 and is initialized with random colors.
- Each turn the player must choose a color and type it in (red (r), blue (b), green (g), yellow (y))
- The top left cell is the starting cell.
- The new color (that the player chose) spreads to all the neighbors of the starting cell which have the same color as it does.
- To win, the board must be of one color and at a maximum of 21 moves.
- The player loses if after 21 moves the board is not colored in a single color.

## Instructions

1. The implementation should be coded in Python, you can use any package that might help you.

3. Basic inputs are (r- red, b - blue, g - green, y - yellow), you can use standard input and expect the user to press Enter.
4. You can use the internet freely for python and librariesÂ docs and info.
5. Very important: please pay **special attention** to code structure, code readability and take into consideration OOP design principals.
6. This task usually takes 1.5 hours from our experience, if necessary you can have more time up to 2.5 hours.
7. If you've finished ahead of time, please let me know.
8. Feel free to ask me any question that you might have, don't waste time on stuff that you are not sure about - just ask me.
